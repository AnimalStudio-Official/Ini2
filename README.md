# Ini2
## Install
For compiling the source, you would require:
- make
- GNU G++ (>= 11.2.0)
1. Clone the github Ini2 repository with the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AnimalStudio-Official/Ini2 Ini2 --recursive
   ``` 
   Make sure you use the *--recursive* flag since the code has some submodule dependencies
    
2. Move into the *Ini2* directory using 

        cd Ini2
3. Now we will compile the source code using *make*. If your *g++* points to one of the suitable compilers listed above the simply run 
    
        make
